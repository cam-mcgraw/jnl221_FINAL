        <h1>Theaters Are Back, But Box Office Numbers Haven’t Fully Returned</h1>
        <p class="deck"> After a nosedive in 2020, revenue has slowly climbed, but still lags behind pre-pandemic levels, as streaming reshapes how audiences choose to watch new releases.

        <p>Over the last seven years, U.S. box office revenue has dropped by more than 20 percent, while the number of theatrical releases has shrunk by well over a quarter. Theaters that were once a staple of weekend plans now face thinning crowds and fewer films. Although the entertainment industry remains a lucrative business, a major shift is underway and raises a question: why are movie theaters becoming less central to American culture?</p>

        <p>In 2017, going to the movies was a weekly ritual for many Americans. Hits like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/">“Get Out” </a>and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3874544/">“The Boss Baby” </a>filled seats. Theaters regularly drew in over $11 million per day, with weekends driving the bulk of that revenue. Even on slower weekdays, smaller films managed to attract steady crowds. The rhythm of theatrical viewing held firm year-round, peaking during holidays and blockbuster releases.

        <iframe class="vis1" alt= "A vertical bar chart showing a crash in gross box office revenue in 2020 and a slight uptick after in the folowing four years"title="Box Office Revenue Still Trails Pre-COVID Levels" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-tLTMI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tLTMI/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="457" height="485" data-external="1"></iframe>


        <p>Fast forward to 2024, and moviegoing is more like a special occasion than a routine habit. Theaters struggle to crack $10 million a day, and are even more dependent on weekends. Originality is increasingly scarce as studios lean on sequels and existing intellectual property (IP). Movies like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13622970/">“Moana 2” </a>and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13186482/">“Mufasa: The Lion King” </a>are among the latest examples. A major catalyst for this shift arrived in 2020: streaming. </p>
        
        <p>Shaina Holmes, a professor at Syracuse University with over two decades of industry experience on films like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332280/">“The Notebook” </a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0942385/">“Tropic Thunder,” </a> said the entertainment industry often transforms through disruption. She recalled how a 2011 tsunami in Japan abruptly halted her production and destroyed vital tape footage. It forced her team to adopt digital workflows. The switch was initially out of desperation, but was eventually fully adopted to finish production. Within a year, tape was nearly obsolete in the movie industry. </p>

        <p>Holmes compared that disaster to the COVID-19 pandemic, another force that radically changed how films are made and consumed. Studios shifted workflows online, post-production became remote and most importantly, audiences were stuck at home eager for a new way of watching. </p>

        <p>Ed Hersh, chief creative officer of <a href="https://www.storycentric.com/">StoryCentric LLC, </a> echoed that view from the audience’s perspective. Like Holmes, he emphasized that streaming became the default simply because it was accessible from practically any device. He described the pandemic as a moment when families were trapped at home, but together. He said, entertainment became a tool for connection. Streaming wasn’t just convenient, it was comforting. </p>

        <p>The pandemic wasn’t just a time for studios to cater to a captive audience, but a time to reflect their emotions. Hersh noted that films centered on family and inclusion resonated deeply during lockdown, when togetherness became both a challenge and a necessity. Audiences weren’t just watching, they were seeking stories that mirrored their lives. </p>

        <p>Streaming also offered something theaters couldn’t: choice. While a theater may showcase five to 10 films at a time, platforms like <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/?cid=2301evgpkpdsearch11571&utm_campaign=2301evg&utm_source=pk_ggl_gglsa&utm_medium=pd_search_br_srcpy&utm_term=126778&utm_content=126778_126778&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACqYaJpvS10r_WZTX8Jq5eCDyihMb&gclid=Cj0KCQjww-HABhCGARIsALLO6Xz5pj8sAIvFh0l2KIkVyFg3f54CZD8UJeJk3dxWbJJhwhf8spidXxoaAj5GEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">Peacock </a> and <a href="https://www.max.com/">Max </a>can host hundreds. That flexibility means viewers can choose content that matches their mood in the moment. In a culture increasingly shaped by convenience and personalization, streaming meets people where they are. </p>

        <p>Today, though Americans are no longer trapped at home, they still haven’t fully returned to pre-COVID routines. Hersh extrapolated, pointing out that working from home, ordering in and staying in on weekends have become far more common. The theater landscape has changed accordingly. Holmes said major cultural moments like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barbenheimer-barbie-vs-oppenheimer-61a6ec6c67359b851ddeccd6d655b5ab">“Barbenheimer” </a> or <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3566834/">“A Minecraft Movie” </a> still drive ticket sales, but in between, attendance has dropped. The market for smaller theatrical films is shrinking. </p>

        <p>Holmes, a regular film festival attendee, observed how festivals once served as platforms for indie films to land distribution. Today, most films shown already have deals with services like <a href="https://tv.apple.com/channel/tvs.sbd.4000?mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&mttnagencyid=a5e&mttncc=US&mttnsiteid=143238&mttnsubad=OUS2019801_1-713951819730-c&mttnsubkw=75222244984_kwd-67743848_idXQ476O_&mttnsubplmnt=_adext_">Apple TV </a>or <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix </a>, and go straight to streaming. Holmes said, “Festivals used to be about discovery. Now, it’s more like marketing.” </p>

        <iframe class="vis2" alt= "A vertical bar chart showing a drop in movie releases in 2020 and a steady but slow rise in the following four years" title="Studios Scale Back Releases Post-COVID" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ubQ9X" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ubQ9X/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="497" data-external="1"></iframe>
        
        <p>Hersh explained the shift using a simple comparison, “It’s like going out to eat, when prices rise, people ask if it’s worth it. Sometimes they’d rather just stay in and make pasta.” A family of four can spend more than $100 at the movies, while streaming costs around $15 a month. With more options, more comfort and lower costs, many families choose to stay home.

        <p>Still, some industry experts see a path forward. While theaters may never return to their previous success, they can still share the spotlight with streaming. Hersh referenced screenwriter William Goldman’s famous quote about the unpredictability of the film industry saying, “Nobody knows anything.” He said in a medium driven by emotion and unpredictability, the phrase still holds true. A movie like <a href= "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1745960/">“Top Gun: Maverick” </a> was expected to flop post-COVID, but was a great success and soared to $1.5 billion worldwide. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1684562/">“The Fall Guy,” </a>based on an existing IP, underperformed.  

        <p>Since 2017, both revenue and the number of releases have declined, but Holmes and Hersh believe theaters aren't disappearing. They agree that studios will continue to push guaranteed blockbusters for theatrical runs, while smaller titles will likely be reserved for streaming. The result may be fewer films in theaters, but those releases will be more targeted and intentional.

        <p>Despite the shift in habits, the cinematic experience isn’t going away; it's evolving. While theaters may no longer be the standard, they still offer a viewing experience that streaming can’t replicate. As the industry adapts to post-pandemic changes, the future of film likely won’t be a battle between theaters and streaming, but a balance between them. For audiences, that means more ways to watch, whether at home or in the theater.
